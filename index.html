        Hi, I'm Raymond.

      <p class = "main-text">
      	I'm a programmer and web developer who loves working on programming projects both professionally and in my spare time. I recently completed multiple programming courses through Udacity's Nanodegree program along with lots of independent learning of multiple programming languages. I enjoy working on collaborative projects, helping others with programming, and just about anything involved in the programming process.
        I have the most experience in C++, Python, Javascript, HTML, and CSS, but love to learn new languages. I currently work best with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), but am currently learning Functional programming languages such as Haskell.
